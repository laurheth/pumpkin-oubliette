# Webpack + TypeScript + Sass boilerplate

A simple boilerplate built to have a starting point for new projects based on Webpack, TypeScript, and Sass. Made this to get started on another project of my own, as well as to learn, but if it can be helpful to someone else I encourage you to use it!

## Usage

First, clone the respository.

```
git clone https://github.com/laurheth/webpack-ts-sass-boilerplate.git
cd webpack-ts-sass-boilerplate
```

Then, install all npm packages.

```
npm install
```

Update the contents of ```package.json``` and ```webpack.config.js``` to reflect the title and other details specific to your own project.

To start a new repository:
```
rm -rf .git
git init
```

All code for your project is in ```./src```. Edit as you see fit, then build with:

```
npm run build
```

The results will be in ```./dist```.
